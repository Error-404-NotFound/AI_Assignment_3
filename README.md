## Implemented Algorithms

- **DFBnB (Depth-First Branch and Bound)**  
  Efficient tree-based search for pathfinding in environments like Frozen Lake.

- **IDA\*** (Iterative Deepening A*)  
  Combines depth-first and heuristic search to balance memory and performance.

- **Hill Climbing**  
  Greedy optimization approach for improving tour cost in TSP.

- **Simulated Annealing**  
  Probabilistic optimization technique for escaping local minima in TSP.

## Environments

- **Frozen Lake**  
  Grid world used to test search algorithms like DFBnB and IDA*. [Frozen Lake](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) environment is used for these algorithms.

- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**  
  Custom TSP environment from [VRP-GYM](https://github.com/kevin-schumann/VRP-GYM) is used for optimization algorithms like Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing.

## search_algo/ – Core Algorithm Implementations

This directory contains the core logic for all the search and optimization algorithms implemented in the project. Each file corresponds to a specific algorithm or shared functionality.

### File Descriptions

- **`dfbnb.py`**  
  Implements the **Depth-First Branch and Bound (DFBnB)** algorithm, a tree-based search technique that prunes paths exceeding the current best-known solution. Used primarily for solving navigation problems like Frozen Lake.

- **`ida_star.py`**  
  Implements the **Iterative Deepening A*** (**IDA\***), which combines the space efficiency of depth-first search with the optimality and heuristics of A*. Suited for large search spaces where A* is memory-intensive.

- **`hill_climb.py`**  
  Contains the **Hill Climbing** algorithm, a local search method that iteratively improves a solution by exploring its neighbors. Applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to minimize tour cost.

- **`simulated_annealing.py`**  
  Implements **Simulated Annealing**, a probabilistic algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It allows worse moves occasionally to escape local minima, making it well-suited for TSP and other complex optimization problems.

- **`helpers.py`**  
  Provides utility functions and shared logic used across multiple algorithms such as heuristic calculations, path cost computations, and neighbor generation.

- **`__init__.py`**  
  Makes the directory a Python package, allowing easy imports from `search_algo` in other parts of the codebase (e.g., `from search_algo import dfbnb`).

These implementations are modular and designed to work with various environments defined in `environment.py`, supporting experiments in grid-based navigation and TSP optimization.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of both classical search algorithms and modern optimization techniques across different environments. Through experiments and visualizations, it highlights the strengths, limitations, and performance trade-offs of each approach.

Whether you're navigating a frozen grid or optimizing a TSP route, this repo serves as a comprehensive educational resource for understanding and comparing:

- Informed vs uninformed search strategies
- Greedy local search vs probabilistic exploration
- Time and cost efficiency of different algorithms

Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the implementations for your own experiments or learning purposes.
